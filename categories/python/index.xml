      <description>Pretty, huh? The icon is from theÂ Open Icon Library.
(You can synchronize your ToDo list over multiple PC&amp;rsquo;s just placing the database in a Dropbox folder)
The Motivation I have to admit: I&amp;rsquo;m not an organized person. Over the past few months I have kind of forced myself to write down everything I was doing and all the thoughts I was having, for future (and present) reference. A natural pattern that emerged was that I always had a ToDo list on one of the margins of the most recent notebook page.</description>
