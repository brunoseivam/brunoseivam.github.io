      <description>EDIT: Mark wrote an updated guide here. The BeagleBone Black is an amazingly cheap and powerful development platform that is being used by many people in a lot of projects. That was intentionally vague, because I know that if you ended up here you already know what a BeagleBone Black is.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I got XenomaiÂ to run on my BeagleBone.
First of all I tried these instructions, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the kernel compilation step.</description>
