      <description>Pretty, huh? The icon is from the Open Icon Library.
(You can synchronize your ToDo list over multiple PC&amp;rsquo;s just placing the database in a Dropbox folder)
The Motivation I have to admit: I&amp;rsquo;m not an organized person. Over the past few months I have kind of forced myself to write down everything I was doing and all the thoughts I was having, for future (and present) reference. A natural pattern that emerged was that I always had a ToDo list on one of the margins of the most recent notebook page.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Mark wrote an updated guide here. The BeagleBone Black is an amazingly cheap and powerful development platform that is being used by many people in a lot of projects. That was intentionally vague, because I know that if you ended up here you already know what a BeagleBone Black is.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I got Xenomai to run on my BeagleBone.
First of all I tried these instructions, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the kernel compilation step.</description>
